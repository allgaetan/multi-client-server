# Toolbox 2 - RÃ©seau : TP1 Introduction aux sockets

## Run the project 

In a terminal, compile with GCC [server.c](/server.c) and [client.c](/client.c)
```
gcc -o server server.c
gcc -o client client.c
```
Then run the server file with no arguments in a terminal.
```
./server
```
To test the multi-client functionnality, open as much terminal as you want and launch run the client file with arguments address:port.
```
./client 127.0.0.1:1234
```
Right now it is configured on the port 1234.
Then you can write any message in the client terminals and it will appear in the server terminal and in all the other client terminals.
